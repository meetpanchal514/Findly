## Overview
Findly is a web application designed to help travelers report and recover lost items with ease. Whether itâ€™s a misplaced bag, phone, or set of keys, Findly provides a seamless platform to post, browse, and manage lost items, connecting users with their belongings through a beautifully crafted interface. Inspired by the futuristic aesthetics of iOS 26, Findly embraces a **Liquid Glass** design with translucent elements, neutral colors, and fluid animations, creating an intuitive and visually stunning experience.

## Purpose
The mission of Findly is to simplify the process of reporting and recovering lost items for travelers. By offering a user-friendly platform with a modern, elegant design, Findly bridges the gap between those who lose items and those who find them, fostering a community-driven solution to a common travel challenge.

## Features
- **Report Lost Items**: Users can submit details of lost items, including name, description, location, contact information, and an optional image, through an intuitive form.
- **Browse Lost Items**: View a curated, paginated list of lost items displayed as sleek, animated cards for easy browsing.
- **Remove Items**: Delete items from the database once they are found or no longer relevant.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring accessibility and usability on the go.
- **Persistent Storage**: Item data is securely stored, making it easy to manage and retrieve information.

## Design Inspiration
Findly draws inspiration from iOS 26â€™s **Liquid Glass** aesthetic, characterized by:
- **Translucent UI**: Glassmorphic elements with a subtle blur effect, creating a sense of depth and sophistication.
- **Neutral Color Palette**: Soft, neutral tones (e.g., light grays, deep blacks) that adapt seamlessly to light and dark modes.
- **Refractive Animations**: Subtle, shimmering animations that enhance the visual experience, giving cards and forms a dynamic, reflective quality.
- **Adaptive Light/Dark Mode**: Automatically adjusts to the userâ€™s system theme, ensuring a comfortable experience in any lighting condition.

The design prioritizes clarity and elegance, making every interaction feel fluid and modern, akin to a premium mobile operating system.
